The fastest way to share your content, and encourage people to read your content based on the share counts. Optimized for page load speed.

== Description ==

Sharing plugin, optimized for page load speed.  We consolidate all icons and counts as much as possible to
minimize network requests.

* Facebook
* Twitter
* Google+
* LinkedIn

Shows the counts of each social media platform for the given blog post.

* Enable Buttons on the top and/or bottom of posts

 - Counts will still be correct, even with multiple posts on a page.
